++i is a pre-increment; i++ is post-increment.
The downside of post-increment is that it generates an extra value; it returns a copy of the old value while modifying i. Thus, you should avoid it when possible.

++i is slightly more efficient due to its semantics:

++i;  // Fetch i, increment it, and return it
i++;  // Fetch i, copy it, increment i, return copy


a++ is known as postfix.

add 1 to a, returns the old value.

++a is known as prefix.

add 1 to a, returns the new value.
